## Leg 1 Grading

### Tyler's Notes

1. There's no such thing as an ARRAY in databases. You need to have a seperate table with Foreign Keys to this object.  

1. There's also no such thing as a HASH TABLE here. I'm not sure what you were going for with this one, to be honest, but it can probably also be replaced with Foreign Keys. Foreign Keys are love. Foreign Keys are life.

### Grade

1. Project: 8/10. The written plan for your project is great. The schema that you have will need some work. I recommend that you look at the available model fields in Django and see if there are some that fit your needs. And always feel free to come in to office hours!
